ðŸŽ¯ FPS Target Shooting Game â€“ UE5
A simple 3D first-person shooter made with Unreal Engine 5. The player must find and shoot all hidden targets in a limited time. The countdown timer starts at 100 and races to 0â€”can you beat the clock?

Features:

Smooth first-person controls

Timer-based gameplay (100 to 0)

3D environment with scattered targets

Win condition: shoot all targets before time runs out

This was one of my early Unreal Engine projectsâ€”basic, fun, and a great learning experience!
